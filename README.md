# In Class Lab- Using React 


## Setup

```npm install```

```npm start```

Directory Structure

Write your code in the src directory. When it is compiled, it will be placed in the compiled directory.

Usage

This playground uses Babel to ensure that all the newest ES features are supported.

Use the npm run file script to run a file. This will run gulp and then execute the file provided as an argument.

Make sure you execute files in the compiled directory, not the src directory.

## Dependency

```npm i -S react-redux```

``` npm install --save redux-devtools-extension```

## Pattern
```npm run file -- compiled/**/[FILENAME]```

## Example
```npm run file -- compiled/src/demo.js```
